c WORKING PG for linear/elliptical particle motion.
c
c This program computes the degree of polarization (dop)
c for three component sensors employing sliding data windows
c as function of frequency.
c
c The employed dop strategy has been introduced in 
c Schimmel & Gallart (2003) using analytic signal theory in 
c the t-domain. Later, in Schimmel & Gallart (2004), the dop 
c strategy has been extended to the tf-domain, but 
c using now a different strategy to compute the polarization 
c attributes. Main reason for changing the way to determine 
c polarization attributes has been to get experiences with 
c other approaches and to show that the dop strategy is 
c independent on the polarization approach.
c
c Thus, this program uses an eigen approach (eigen values and 
c eigen vectors) to construct the dop following the
c time-domain definition. A freq-dependent Gaussian window 
c can be used. This version is up-graded using the S-Transform 
c which is very similar to my 1st approach. 
c
c The polarization approach has been used for filtering 
c Schimmel and Gallart (2003,2004,2005) and signal characterization
c Stutzmann et al. (2009), Schimmel et al. (2011), Obrebski et al. (2012),
c Sergeant et al. (2013), Davy et al. (2015).

c This a WORKING (RESEARCH) VERSION rather than a final program.
c I constantly adapt it.
c Simplifications are required for the straight final code.
c The program contains options which are not useful any more
c or which were coded for a very specific purpose. These will be
c removed in a future version of this program.
c This research program is not for distribution.

c HOW to start:
c 1. compile together with sac-library.
c 2. just execute polfre_s1.66el without any argument to
c    obtain the list of parameters and their usage.
c 3. see my example and play with the scripts.

c not hesitate to send me your comments on interesting,
c modifications or results.
